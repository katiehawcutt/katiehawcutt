## Hi, I'm Katie...

<img src="">

I'm a full-stack software developer based in Birmingham and I'm currently training with the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) on their 16 week, full-time, fully-immersive programming bootcamp.

After a decade of working in the music industry I was ready for a new challenge in life so I swapped the language of jazz ðŸŽ· for the language of JavaScript ðŸ’» and joined the School of Code! This has led to opportunities to exercise creative problem solving in a whole new realm.

There are many reasons why I was inspired to make the leap into the tech sector. Aside from really enjoying both the creative and technical aspects of coding, I want to work in a fast pace, innovative environment and be part of a team where there are opportunities to constantly grow and learn. I am excited about having the chance to really make a difference by creating software which solves real-world problems. Technology inspires and drives the way the world functions and lives, and I want to play my part in shaping its future development âœ¨

My GitHub repo's really document my learning journey into the world of programming. I recently finished [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) which was a truly amazing challenge and you can find my diary [here](https://github.com/katiehawcutt/100DaysOfCode).

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katiehawcutt/) and [Dev](https://dev.to/katiehawcutt).

Feel free to say hi ðŸ™‚
