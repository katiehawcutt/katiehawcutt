## Hi, I'm Katie...

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katiehawcutt/katiehawcutt/master/Katie.png" style="width:250px;">

Iâ€™ve spent the last 10 years working in the music industry which has been fantastic! ðŸŽ· But Iâ€™m now embracing a new challenge in life and I'm learning to code. ðŸ’»

I'm an aspiring web developer and would love to transition to a job in the tech sector.

So far this year I've mostly been learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a bit of SQL. You can check out some of my projects [here](https://github.com/katiehawcutt?tab=repositories).

I'm currently doing #100DaysOfCode and you can follow my journey on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/katie_hawcutt) or check out my [100 Days Of Code Diary](https://github.com/katiehawcutt/100DaysOfCode).

I can also be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katiehawcutt/) and [Dev](https://dev.to/katiehawcutt).

Feel free to say hi ðŸ™‚
