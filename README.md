## Hi, I'm Katie...

I'm a full-stack software developer based in Birmingham with a passion for creative problem solving.

After a decade of working in the music industry I was ready for a new challenge in life so I swapped the saxophone ðŸŽ· for a keyboard ðŸ’» and traded in the language of jazz for the language of JavaScript! I graduated from the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) (a 16 week, full-time, fully-immersive programming bootcamp) in January 2021 and landed my first job as a junior full-stack software engineer in mid-February.

There are many reasons why I was inspired to make the leap into the tech sector. Aside from really enjoying both the creative and technical aspects of coding, I love working in a fast pace, innovative environment and being part of a team where there are opportunities to constantly grow and learn. Technology inspires and drives the way the world functions and lives, and I want to play my part in shaping its future development âœ¨

My GitHub repo's document my learning journey into the world of programming. In November 2020 I finished my first [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) which was a truly amazing challenge and you can read my diary [here](https://github.com/katiehawcutt/100DaysOfCode).

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katiehawcutt/) and [Dev](https://dev.to/katiehawcutt).

Feel free to say hi ðŸ™‚
